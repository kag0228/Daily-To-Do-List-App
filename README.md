# Daily-To-Do-List-App
A personal to-do list application for everyday use. 

Key Features:

Daily Refresh - The app automatically detects when a new day begins and refreshes your list
Carry Over Confirmation - When you open the app on a new day with incomplete tasks from yesterday, you'll get a dialog asking which tasks you want to carry over. You can select individual items, select all, or start fresh
Accomplishments Tracking - Completed tasks are moved to a separate Accomplishments section where you can review them organized by date
Persistent Storage - All your data is saved automatically and persists across sessions using the storage API

How to Use:

Add tasks using the input field and "Add" button (or press Enter)
Click the green circle to mark a task as complete (moves it to Accomplishments)
Click the red X to delete a task without marking it complete
Click "Accomplishments" to view your completed tasks organized by date
When you return on a new day, you'll be prompted to carry over any incomplete tasks

The app uses a clean, modern design with a blue theme for active tasks and green for accomplishments. Everything saves automatically, so your data is always preserved!
